Problem2;
BitWizz loves strings and especially permutations. He loves to play with such strings. While exploring,
he encountered a problem and wants you to solve for him. You are a given a string S and a string T both of which
contain only lower case letters.

Write a program to count the number of distinct permutations of S which appear as a substring of T at least once.
Note that S can have anywhere between 1 and |S|! distinct permutations in total.

Input:
The first line contains string S
The second line contains string T

Output:
The number of distinct permutations of S which appear as a substring of T.

Constraints:
1 <= |S| <= 200000
1 <= |T| <= 200000
